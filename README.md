## What's this?

`lori_server` is an intermediary server to a locally run LLM which implements web crawling, sandboxed file access and other useful chatbot integrations for [`ollama-chat`](https://github.com/spectrachrome/ollama-chat) using a plugin architecture. 

*This project is currently in alpha and not usable for anything except for casual chat with a local Ollama model with some Markdown and syntax highlighting. Expect earth-shattering changes.*
